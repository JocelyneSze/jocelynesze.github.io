*"How are you?"* people ask, as a greeting.

*"I'm okay"* I mumble, unsure if I should say more.

What do I say? I am fine, I am healthy, I am well-fed, I have water, juice, beer, any drink I want, I have a warm bed in a house, I have a monthly salary, I can travel freely, I have activities to occupy my free time.

But what do I not say? I am not fine, I don't understand how we are living in a world that accepts human beings blown to shreds, headless, armless, decapitated, burnt, starved, sickened, subjected to sexual abuse of the most vile, torture of physical, mental, emotional nature. Babies, children, teenagers, young men & women, old men & women. All the time, live-streamed to us, the rest of the world, in our safe houses and bubbles. 

I try to ignore, to live, to do my work. Conservation. Justice, social and environmental justice. Indigenous Peoples' rights. International law. Saving nature, biodiversity, landscapes, people-place connections.

And I'm reminded, over and over again, that humans, thousands and thousands of humans, are being torn apart simply for living in their own land, because colonisers want that property. Don't even think about the damage to trees, to animals, or the carbon emissions from this genocidal campaign. Is this going to be sold as a carbon neutral project in the future? All the emissions from shipping arms and weapons, spy planes, missiles and drones, computer systems that do the automated killing of humans, the emissions from the bombs dropped, all of that offset by fast-growing trees planted over the graves of Palestinian peoples and their rights. 


Injustice is no longer a sufficient term for the depraved atrocities that Israel, enabled by the USA, UK, EU, all the White Colonisers, is committing with impunity. What the Palestinians (and Yemenis and Syrians and Lebanese) are made to go through are more than injustices. I don't know a word in English sufficient to capture the depth and breadth of the complete annihilation of a People and Their Land. 

## Are we able to be okay, when inhumanity takes power?
