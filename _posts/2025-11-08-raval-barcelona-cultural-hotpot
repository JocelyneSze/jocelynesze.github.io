I don't often write about my personal quotidian experiences anymore, in part because it doesn't seem necessary or useful, in part because I don't like to overshare publicly. But I was recently in the El Raval neighbourhood of Barcelona, part of the old city with its narrow alleyways. It was a most interesting experience to have in the capital of Catalunya that I felt it had to be penned down somewhere. 

Going for a Palestinian film event in a Lebanese cafe. In English, though you hear Arabic all around. Get hummous or whatever other Levantine snacks.

Then going to get some fresh vegetables (even on a Sunday, perhaps the only place in Barcelona where you're guaranteed to be able to get groceries still). South Asian, perhaps Pakistani guy behind the counter, got some long brinjals and chye sim. 

Then passing a supermarket, Awami a chain run by South Asians, perhaps again Pakistani. Get some foul maddames fava beans, and they had good brands of coconut milk at a decent price too. Nepali family ahead of me in the queue. 

Little bit hungry, but not wanting to sit in a samosa cafe takeaway place for 2 hours while waiting for some friends, deicded to just wander along the road. Went into a Humana Vintage second hand clothing shop, many young, white-passing, hippie people browsing. 

Came to a plaza in front of a church, small gatherings of people and I went to look. People had set up stalls selling food, Filipino community. Turns out the church has a big congregation of Filipinos and mass was going to start soon and people were opportunistically selling Pinoy street food. Bought myself a spring roll and banana roll, then went for Tagalog mass with all the Filipinos.
